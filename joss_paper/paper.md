# Summary

Discrete-event simulation (DES) is a dynamical simulation method that analyzes systems whose events occur at discrete instants in time.
Many fields employ models that use DES, including computer network performance analysis, biochemical modeling, war gaming, modeling of infectious disease transmission, and others.

The construction of DES models can be simplified and accelerated by using a DES simulator that implements the generic features needed by all DES models, such as executing events in increasing simulation time order.
Model construction can be further enhanced, and models can be made more comprehensible and reusable, by structuring models as object-oriented programs.
This approach, which is known as *object-oriented discrete-event simulation*, encourages modelers to represent entities in the system being modeled as objects in a model, and represent interactions between entities as event messages in the model.

DE-Sim is a Python package that provides a DES simulator that supports object-oriented (OO) DES models.
