`DE-Sim` documentation
======================

`DE-Sim` provides an object-oriented discrete event simulation tool for Python. 

`DE-Sim` is similar to `Simula <http://www.simula67.info/>`_. Simulation logical processes are objects, and they schedule simulation events by exchanging messages. Simulation applications are composed of multiple subclasses of :py:class`de_sim.simulation_object.SimulationObject`.
