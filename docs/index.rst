*DE-Sim* documentation
======================

*DE-Sim* provides an object-oriented discrete event simulation tool for Python.

*DE-Sim* is similar to `Simula <http://www.simula67.info/>`_. Simulation logical processes are objects, and they schedule simulation events by exchanging messages. Simulation applications are composed of multiple subclasses of :py:class:`de_sim.simulation_object.SimulationObject`.
