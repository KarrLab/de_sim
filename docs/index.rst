`DE-Sim` documentation
======================

`DE-Sim` provides an object-oriented discrete event simulation
tool for Python that's similar to Simula.
Simulation logical processes are objects and they schedule
simulation events by exchanging messages.
Simulation applications are composed of multiple
subclasses of :py:class:`SimulationObject`.
