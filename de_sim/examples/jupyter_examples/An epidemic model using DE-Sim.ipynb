    "# A stochastic epidemic model\n",
    "\n",
    "Epidemics occur when infectious diseases spread through a susceptible population.\n",
    "Models that classify individuals by their infectious state are widely used to analyze and predict the dynamics of epidemics.\n",
    "A well-known and simple approach considers these three infectious states:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Susceptible*: an individual who can become infected if exposed\n",
    "* *Infectious*: an individual who is infected, and can transmit the infection to a person who is susceptible\n",
    "* *Recovered*: an individual who has recovered from an infection, and is not susceptible to being reinfected\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic analyses of spreading infection that employ these states are called Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered (SIR) epidemic models.\n",
    "SIR models are characterized by the initial population of individuals in each state and the rate at which individuals transition between states.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SIR model states and transitions](SIR_Flow_Diagram.svg)\n",
    "*SIR model states and transitions*<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this figure, the transitions between states are labeled with the standard SIR transition rates, in individuals per unit time.\n",
    "S and I represent the number of individuals in states Susceptible and Infectious, respectively. &beta; and &gamma; are model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present a stochastic SIR model that demonstrates core features of DE-Sim.\n",
    "Epidemics must be modelled stochastically when the number of infectious individuals is small or when variability in the rates of transitions between model states influences an epidemic's trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIR model below uses DE-Sim to implement a continuous-time Markov chain model, as described in section 3 of Allen (2017).\n",
    "It represents transitions by individuals to a new state as discrete events and selects each transition and its timing by random samples of their distributions.\n",
    "See Allen (2017) for a mathematical derivation of the approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement and use the SIR model.\n",
    "First, use `pip` to install `de_sim`.\n",
