    "A subclass of `SimulationObject` contains special methods and attributes that define its simulation behavior.\n",

    "* Special methods\n",
    "  1. `init_before_run` (optional): just before a simulation run, after all simulation objects have been added to a `Simulator`, the simulator calls `init_before_run` in each simulation object. Simulation objects can send initial events and perform any other initialization in `init_before_run`. For example, in `RandomWalkSimulationObject`, the `init_before_run` method initializes the simulation object's position and history attributed, and schedules the object's first event, which carries a `RandomStepMessage` message. A simulation must send at least one initial event to initiate the simulation's execution.\n",
    "  2. `send_event`: `send_event(delay, receiving_object, event_message)` schedules an event to occur `delay` time units in the future at simulation object `receiving_object`, which will execute a simulation event containing `event_message`. An event can be scheduled for any simulation object in a simulation, including the object scheduling the event, as shown in `RandomWalkSimulationObject`. `event_message` must be an instance of an `EventMessage`. \n",
    "  The event will be executed by an event handler in simulation object `receiving_object`, with a parameter that is set to a simulation event containing `event_message` at its scheduled simulation time. In this example all simulation events are scheduled to be executed by the object that creates the event, but most realistic simulations contain multiple simulation objects which schedule events for each other. \n",
    "  Object-oriented DES terminology also describes the event message as being sent by the sending object at the message's send time (the simulation time when the event is scheduled) and being received by the receiving object at the event's receive time (the simulation time when the event is executed).\n",
    "  3. event handlers: an event handler is a method that handles a simulation event. Event handlers have the signature `event_handler(self, event)`, where `event` is a DE-Sim simulation event (`de_sim.Event`). A subclass of `SimulationObject` must define at least one event handler, like `handle_step_event` in the example above.\n",
    "* Special attributes\n",
    "  1. `event_handlers`: the attribute `event_handlers` must contain a list of pairs that maps each event message type received by a subclass of `SimulationObject` to the subclass' event handler which handles the event message type. In the example above, `event_handlers` associates `RandomStepMessage` event messages with the `handle_step_event` event handler. The DE-Sim simulator contains a scheduler that runs an object dispatch algorithm which executes an event by using the `event_handlers` attribute of the receiving object identified in the event to determine the object's method that will execute the event. It then dispatches execution to that method in the receiving object while passing the event as an argument.\n",
    "  2. `messages_sent`: the types of messages sent by a subclass of `SimulationObject` must be listed in `messages_sent`. This is used to ensure that a simulation object doesn't send messages of the wrong class.\n",
    "  3. `time`: `time` is a read-only simulation object attribute that always equals the current simulation time. `RandomWalkSimulationObject` uses `time` to saves its value when recording the history history."
