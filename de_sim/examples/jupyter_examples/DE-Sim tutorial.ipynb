Event handlers have the signature `event_handler(event)`, where `event` is a DE-Sim simulation event (`de_sim.event.Event`). A subclass of `ApplicationSimulationObject` must define at least one event handler, like `handle_simulation_event` in the example above.\n",

In the example above, `event_handlers` associates `MessageSentToSelf` event messages with the `handle_simulation_event` event handler. The object dispatch algorithm in the DE-Sim simulator scheduler executes an event by using the receiving object identified in the message and its `event_handlers` attribute to determine the object's method that should execute the event. It then dispatches execution to that method in the receiving object while passing the event as an argument.\n",

    "### Global mechanism: simultaneous event messages at multiple simulation objects\n",
    "A *global* mechanism is needed to ensure that simultaneous events which occur at distinct objects in a simulation are executed in a deterministic order.\n",
    "Otherwise, the discrete-event simulator might execute simultaneous events at distinct simulation objects in a different order in different simulation runs that use the same input.\n",
    "When using a simulator that allows 0-delay event messages or global state shared between simulation objects -- both of which DE-Sim supports -- this can alter the simulation's predictions and thereby imperil debugging efforts, statistical analyses of predictions and other essential uses of simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global mechanism employed by DE-Sim conceives of the simulation time as a pair -- the event time, and a *sub-time* which breaks event time ties.\n",
    "Sub-time values within a particular simulation time must be distinct.\n",
    "Given that constraint, many approaches for selecting the sub-time would achieve the objective.\n",
    "DE-Sim creates a distinct sub-time from the state of the simulation object receiving an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sub-time is a pair composed of a priority assigned to the simulation class and a unique identifier for each class instance.\n",
    "Each simulation class defines a `class_priority` attribute that determines the relative execution order of simultaneous events by different simulation classes.\n",
    "Among multiple instances of a simulation class, the attribute `event_time_tiebreaker`, which defaults to a simulation instance's unique name, breaks ties.\n",
    "All classes have the same default priority of `LOW`. If class priorities are not set and  `event_time_tiebreaker`s are not set for individual simulation objects, then an object's global priority is given by its name."
