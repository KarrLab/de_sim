    "\n",
    "As in an OO program, the classes used by a DES application encapsulate data and code that determine the application's behavior.\n",
    "Subclasses of `ApplicationSimulationObject`, called *simulation objects*, are special simulation classes that handle simulation events.\n",
    "Simulation objects are like threads, as they are run by a simulation's scheduler and suspend execution when they have no work to do. \n",
    "But DES simulation objects and threads are scheduled by different algorithms.\n",
    "Whereas threads are scheduled whenever they have work to do,\n",
    "a DES scheduler schedules simulation objects to ensure that events occur in simulation time order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All events in a simulation are executed in non-decreasing time order. (Events with equal simulation times are scheduled according to the tie-breaking rules discussed below.) \n",
    "\n",
    "By guaranteeing this behavior, a DES scheduler ensures that causality relationships between events are respected.\n",
    "This rule has two consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each simulation object executes its events in increasing time order. DE-Sim achieves this by having any simulation object that receives multiple events at a given simulation time execute *all* of the events together.\n",
    "2. All synchronization between simulation objects is controlled by the simulation times of events.\n",

Simulation objects can send initial events and perform any other initialization in this method. A simulation must send at least one initial event to initiate the simulation's execution.\n",
    "  2. event handlers: an event handler is a method that handles a simulation event. Event handlers have the signature `event_handler(event)`, where `event` is a DE-Sim simulation event (`de_sim.event.Event`). A subclass of `ApplicationSimulationObject` must define at least one event handler, like `handle_simulation_event` in the example above.\n",
    "* Special attributes\n",
    "  1. `event_handlers`: the attribute `event_handlers` must contain a list of pairs that maps each event message type received by a subclass of `ApplicationSimulationObject` to the subclass' event handler which handles the event message type. In the example above, `event_handlers` associates `MessageSentToSelf` event messages with the `handle_simulation_event` event handler. The object dispatch algorithm in the DE-Sim simulator scheduler executes an event by using the receiving object identified in the message and its `event_handlers` attribute to determine the object's method that should execute the event. It then dispatches execution to that method in the receiving object while passing the event as an argument.\n",
    "  2. `messages_sent`: the types of messages sent by a subclass of `ApplicationSimulationObject` are listed in `messages_sent`, which is used to ensure that a simulation object doesn't send messages of the wrong type.\n",

    "To schedule events, `ApplicationSimulationObject` provides the method\n",
    "\n",
    "    send_event(delay, receiving_object, event_message)\n",
    "    \n",
    "which schedules an event to occur `delay` time units in the future at simulation object `receiving_object`, which will execute a simulation event containing `event_message`.\n",
    "An event can be scheduled for any simulation object in a simulation, including the object scheduling the event, as shown in the example above.\n",
    "Object-oriented DES terminology also describes the event message as being sent by the sending object at the message's send time (the simulation time when the event is scheduled) and being received by the receiving object at the event's receive time (the simulation time when the event is executed).\n",
    "\n",
    "`event_message` must be an instance of a `SimulationMessage`, and may have attributes that contain data used by the event.\n",
    "The event will be executed by an event handler in simulation object `receiving_object`,\n",
