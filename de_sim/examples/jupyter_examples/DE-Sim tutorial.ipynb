Event handlers have the signature `event_handler(event)`, where `event` is a DE-Sim simulation event (`de_sim.event.Event`).

In the example above, `event_handlers` associates `MessageSentToSelf` event messages with the `handle_simulation_event` event handler. The object dispatch algorithm in the DE-Sim simulator scheduler executes an event by using the receiving object identified in the message and its `event_handlers` attribute to determine the object's method that should execute the event. It then dispatches execution to that method in the receiving object while passing the event as an argument.\n",
